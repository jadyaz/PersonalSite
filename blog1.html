            <h1 style="margin-top: 20px;">Internships and Universities</h1>
            <p>It's hard to express how valuable my time at the University of Michigan was for me professionally and personally.
                I learned so much about myself and the field I chose, I can't imagine what my life would be like now if I had went somewhere else
                for my undergrad. Being surrounded by students and faculty who consistently made me a better programmer, student, and person was an invaluable experience.
                Despite the multitudes of benefits my alma mater provided me, there was a distinct blindsight in preparing students, myself included, for the internship search.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me preface this by saying that I was fortunate enough to find two relevant internships over the course of my undergrad.
                This is not an expression of anger or resentment but a more detached assesment in one of Umich's rare failures. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I think back to my internship search, the primary emotion I associate with it is confusion. It felt as if there was little direction beyond what I could gleen from my peers.
                It was rare to hear a professor or other faculty member discuss much about the entire process, beyond a perfunctory nod towards technical interviews. As a result, we students were left 
                to fend for ourselves. I distinctly recall panicking because I began search for openings in late October of my Sophomore year. I was convinced I was late to start, largely due to comparison 
                with my peers. It was my only real metric, and a friend of mine had begun applying in August. As it turns out, his field (business) begins its recruiting cycle much earlier. A distinction 
                no one had impressed upon me. This lack of perspective resulted in a generally nerve racking process. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For many students, the internship search consists of their first forrays into the professional word, and this lack of guidance leads to much confusion.
                While I can't speak for everyone, I distinctly recall both myself and my roomate panicking because we felt we weren't applying enough. We had each set a goal to apply to roughly 8 positions a day, 
                a mark that in hindsight is more than enough. But we had no frame of reference, so we had to intuit a number that felt reasonable and go from there. I also dist remember the feeling of dread mounting with 
                each passing day without a response. I know now that this is ridiculous, but so much anguish could have been saved if somewhere in my coursework I had been informed that the job hunt can be a lengthy process.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not lamenting my path, but rather advocating for larger universities to make more of an effort to bridge that knowledge gap for future classes of students. All of the extensive technical knowledge I recieved 
                would have been useless if I hadn't been able to navigate the corporate world. Anecdotally, I know it is possible for schools to assist their students in the internship hunt. Someone quite close to me attends Eastern Michigan,
                and professors in their program made an individual effort to connect them with potential summer employers. Said professor also kept tabs on the development of their application, helped amend and tailor their resume, and assisted 
                them with interview prep. In general, EMU's faculty did a stellar job in guiding them through the applications, and landed them an internship rather quickly and painlessly, with none of the uncertainty many UMICH students experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recognize the distinction logistically, UMICH has over 32,000 undergrads in its Ann Arbor Campus alone, whereas EMU has around 12,000. Not to mention, the program in the anecdote above is measurably smaller than UMICH's computer science progam. Where their classes
                may have been around 30, UMICH CS courses often exceed 200. Its simply infeasible to have University of Michigan's professors hold their students hands in a similar manner, there are not enough professors to go around.
                That being said, what UMICH can learn from EMU is providing goal posts for its students. UMICH has professional centers and student employment counselors, but their visibility is minimal. I personally did not learn about them until my final semester
                as an undergrad, a sentiment echoed by several of my peers. Many courses provide a "Progress Report" of sorts at the begining of each lecture, it would take minimal effort to occasionally include a single bullet point in those slides indicating where in the application
                process students should find themselves. This would have to be broad as everyone's internship search is different, but even a vague guideline would be a stark improvement over the current information available.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not to say UMICH is intentionally neglecting its students, or that this is a product of maliciousness. The unveristy provides many oppurtunities to its students, I just wish that these were more broadly known. To borrow a term from User Interfacing principles. I wish UMICH's professional
                resources had more learnability.
