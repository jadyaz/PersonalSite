            <p>I grew frustrated with how slowly decisions get made in a group setting, so I decided to create a lightweight application for 
                voting and polling. Its usage is simple, and can be seen in the read me of the provided github repository. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The api work is done through the Crow C++ framework. The relevant JSON information from form submission is sent 
                to the JS scripts, and which serves them in HTML form. This project is currently in MVP 1, so more functionalities and
                visuals will be added over time.
