            <h1 style="margin-top: 20px;"><em>The Boys</em> 5 Man Band</h1>
            <h2>Spoilers for <em>The Boys</em></h2>
            <p>
                The 2019 Amazon adapatation of the comic <em>The Boys</em> is a smash hit, garnering massive viewrship and critical sucess (currently a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes). 
                Its brutal ultra violence, its political commentary of varying subtlety, and the off the rails plot has engrossed viewers for 5 years now. One of the most talked
                about aspects of the show is its subversion of suphero tropes and conventions. The most obvious way this presents itself is the "Supes" themselves. 
                By and large, the shows version of superheros are self aggrandizing, fame chasing, immoral monsters. More akin to entertainers than public servants, a fact <em>The Boys</em> 
                explicitly states in episode 3 of season 4. One of the more underappreciated ways that the show operates outside of typical writing conventions is in the relationships of its characters, 
                both in small individual ways, and larger foundational connections. Little things like Kimiko and Frenchie's relationship being more platonic than romantic operate outside the norms of
                most TV shows. But the trope I wish to explore in this piece is the 5 Man Band.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what is the 5 Man Band? Its rather self explanatory, its 5 characters central to the plot with predefined roles. The typical construction of a 5 Man Band is:
                The Leader, The Lancer (AKA the Foil), The Heart (AKA The Girl), The Big Guy, and The Smart Guy. The Leader is exactly that, the leader of the group. Driving the plot 
                and making most of the decisions, typically this is the main character. The Lancer, the second in command. The Lancer Most often has traits, values, and or a personality that strongly
                contrasts the leaders, serving to balance them narratively. The Heart, or The Girl, is typically viewed as the moral center of the group. Their purpose is to keep the others grounded and heroic, 
                as well as keeping the group together. If there's strife between other members of the group then the heart is there to patch it up. More often than not The Heart is a Woman, hence the alternate name,
                and is typically in some sort of relationship or love triangle with The Leader and or Lancer. The Hearts functions typically is largely emotional, and their actual contributions to major conflicts is smaller than the rest.
                The Big Guy is the muscle, if someone needs to be physically delt with it falls upon the big guy to do so. The prototypical big guy is the largest and most imposing member of the group, but rarely has as much depth as the others
                as they serve a more utilitarian function in the story. The smart guy is similar, intended to solve intellectual problems and puzzles. The smart guy will likely recieve less characterization than The Leader or the Lancer,
                and will be relegated to a few character quirks. One classic example of the 5 Man Band is the original Star Wars Trilogy, with Luke as the Leader, Han the Lancer, Leia serving as the Heart, Chewbacca as the Big Guy, and C3PO/R2D2 the Smart Guy.
                For a slightly more contemporary example we have the Avengers. Captain America is the Leader, Thor the Lancer, Black Widow the Heart, Hulk the Big Guy, and Iron Man as the Smart Guy. Of these two, Star Wars plays the 5 man
                band slightly more straight, with each core member slotting fairly perfectly in to their relevant roles. The Avengers plays with the trope slightly by making Iron Man a combo of the Lancer and Smart Guy, but aside from that the designations match.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what makes <em>The Boys</em> Different? Which of the core members of the titular "Boys" are which? The 5 main members are William Butcher, Mothers Milk, Hughie Campbell, Kimiko, and Frenchie. Starlight is a major component of the show, but she has her own stuff going on.
                Without the context of the show, the assignment seems easy enough. Butcher is the leader, his demeanor is commanding and his visual design exudes masculine authority. Frenchie seems like the Lancer at first glance. He's competent, and he's everything Butcher isn't, willing to deviate
                from the plan, full of joy and laughter, and overtly kind. He contrasts Butcher beautifully as a Lancer. Kimiko should be the Heart, she is the only woman and shes physically small with a generally sweet demeanor.
                MM looks like the Big Guy, he is literally, the biggest guy of the group, with muscles bulging out of his shirt sleaves. Finally, Hughie is a pretty generic smart guy at first glance, he works in tech and is physically unimposing.
                Upon closer inspection, these mappings fall apart pretty quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                First lets talk about the big man himself, Butcher. Butcher is clearly the leader, he commands the rest of The Boys and is the driving force behind most of their operations. Of the 5 Man Band of the Show, he plays it the most straight.
                This isn't to say there are no surprises to be found here. As we saw in the two provided examples, the Leader is usually righteous and good natured, serving to keep everyone on track. More often than not, they are clearly the best option to lead, and they mostly make the correct decisions.
                Butcher is really not like that. While he is clearly a competent leader, he's cold to the point of cruelty, and often leads his "Boys" into horrible situations in service of his goals. Some prime examples of this being enabling Hughie, a scarred and damaged man, to take Temp V, an untested
                drug that is guarenteed to be fatal if used a scant three times. He forces Frenchie to reconnect with Little Nina, his former employer and ruthless gangster, a decision that strips Kimiko of her powers and results in both her and Frenchie being held captive as a direct result of Butcher's butchering 
                of his deal with Nina. Butcher lies to MM and drags him away from his wife and daughter, causing irreperable damage to a happy marriage. These are just a few examples of Butcher's toxicity. I think its safe to say that Luke and Captain America would find the man reprehensible. Butcher's flaws serve
                to make him a pretty stand out character, a departure from the usually upstanding, heroic leaders present in a 5 Man Band.
            </p>
            <p>
                MM is where we see our first major departure from the typical structure of the band. MM is initially slated as the Lancer, in the hierarchy of The Boys, he's established as the second in command and is subservient to Butcher. He does a great job as a foil, but the relationship is inverted from the typical structure.
                Rather than being the hot head, morally gray lancer we see in characters like Han Solo, Batman, or even Daffy Duck, MM is upstanding and disciplined. He says it himself "I respect the chain of command". On the other hand, in the few flashbacks we see in the series, Butcher undercuts Grace Mallory, his predecessor
                as leader on multiple occasions. This is a small inversion of the Lancer archetype, but MM blurs the boundaries in other ways. Typically, when the Leader is missing, and the Lancer is forced into a commanding role everything goes terribly. A sort of assurance to the audience that the leader is in charge for a reason.
                In the Boys, MM does a pretty good job and is reffered to as a "Natural Leader", a rejection of Butcher's superiority. Where MM gets really interesting however, is his role as a pseudo Heart of the group. MM is kind and upstanding, prioritizing the well being of his companions over all else and doing his utmost to bind the groups 
                wounds emotional or otherwise. MM is a field medic, marking him as the healer of the group, a role often assigned to the "Heart" or "Girl". All of this contrasts heavily with the simple fact that MM is just massive, he should absolutely be the Big Guy, but <em>The Boys</em> spits on convention and casts him otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hughie is another interesting case, as he exhibits some traits of the Smart Guy. His tech knowledge proves invaluable at mutliple points in the show, and his generally nerdy demeanor is one you would expect of the brains. He's also pretty bad at fighting, with him mostly taking a back seat when The Boys are taking care of business.
                The show establishes pretty early on however that he really isn't any smarter than the other Boys outside of his field of expertise. MM calls him a "Stephen F****** Hawking" near the beggining of the first season, signaling to the audience how they should view him. His inexperience often leads him to make poor decisions, 
                a trait distinctly removed from the typical Smart Guy. So then, what is Hughie? He's the closest thing we have to a main character, something that typically indicates he'd be a leader. But everytime Hughie is in the position to command the others, things go sideways instantaneously. No, Hughie is no leader, in fact he's pretty passive 
                character. This is our first indication of what Hughie is, our Heart or Girl. He's the most morally righteous of our characters, keeping everyone else on the straight and narrow in a world that often rewards detachment and outright evil. His own words summarize it best "We save everyone, even if they don't deserve it. Especially if they don't deserve it".
                Despite his trauma, his physical inadequacy, and his general lack of know how, its Hughie's ideals that make him the closest thing to a true hero we have in our titular group. And this is what makes Hughie work as our lead, when typically it might be unthinkable to have the Heart occupy such a prominent position. Hughie doesn't really have a core motivation
                anymore now that he's forgiven A-Train, beyond a general sense of righteousness and a desire to do the right thing. This isn't typically a recipe for success in a main protagonist, most protagonists have a clear end goal, like Butcher's current desire to rescue Ryan, his wife's son. But despite this, Hughie is a great character to follow, because his goal is to
                heal and be better, to be a good man in a world where the good guys never win. We're invested in Hughie because his central conflict is not Hughie VS A-Train or Hughie VS Homelander. It's Hughie VS his circumstances, and his resistance to a world that wants to rip his ideals apart. With each episode he's pushed closer and closer to the edge, to the moral ambiguity
                his teamates embody, but he persists, and in doing so he makes everyone around him a little better. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So if Hughie's the Girl, where does that leave our actual girl, Kimiko? Well she's the big guy, naturally. In it's quest to turn the conventions of writing on their heads, <em>The Boys</em> casts the 5'2 Karen Fukuhara as their muscle. Similarly to MM this is a fun scrambling of visual signifiers. Watching Kimiko fantasize about singing on tabletops immediately cut 
                to this diminutive woman enact some of the most horrific acts of violence in the entire show is shocking and morbidly funny. She's also the only member of the boys capable of standing up to the supercharged "Heros" our cast has to contend with, even breaking A-Train's (a flash analog) leg. Her deceptive strength is also thematically appropriate, as what enables Kimiko's
                strength is the drug Compound V, which grants characters super human abilites. In the world of <em>The Boys</em> compound V absolutely guts the natural order of the world, but Kimiko is a rare example of this being for the better. Kimiko's subversion of the Big Guy trope doesn't extend far beyond this visual trickery, but it's executed highly effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                And finally we come to Frenchie. By process of elimination, we know he must be the Smart Guy, but how well does he fit that mold? Frenchie is a former assassin for the russian mob, a drug abuser, a gun runner, and a gifted chemist. Frenchie was originally selected for The Boys due to his "imagination" when it comes to combatting supes. Frenchie is sort of a genius,
                he engineers various chemicals for combatting the supes and devises strategies to defeat power houses like Transluscent and Stormfront, without him The Boys would be dead in the water. So he's the smart guy right? He has the typical technical expertise of one after all. Frenchie is fascinating however for his aesthetics. Your typical Smart Guy is reserved and quiet, always
                in control, and a bit of a goody two shoes. Think of C3PO's and <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> smart guy Percival de Rolo's handwringing about decorum and conduct. Frenchie by contrast is a complete mess, when asked if he's high (which happens a few times) he typically responds with  "That goes without saying". Frenchie is not hung up on being correct, he dances, flouts
                protocol, makes raunchy jokes, and is generally a bit of a wild card. Handing out drugs like their candy, and all the while being one of the smartest people in <em>The Boys</em>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So why does this matter? It's cool that our characters are a unique departure from a stereotypical 5 Man Band, but thats enough to elevate the show on its own. No I care about this unconventionality because it helps serve one of the main themes of the show, that not everything is what it seems. The caped crusaders and ostensible heros we see are generally awful people, but 
                Vought, the company that employs them white washes them and controls their public image, leading to most civilians being completely unaware of their short comings. Stormfront, a white supremacist adopts language, hairstyle, and demeanors typically associated with progressives in order to manipulate civilians, really underscoring the message "don't judge a book by its cover".
                The Boys similarly manipulate their audience with how they present themselves, forcing them to challenge their biases and assumptions. It's little details like this that really help make the world of the show as engrossing as it is.
